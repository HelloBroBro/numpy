New ``copy`` keyword meaning for `numpy.array` and `numpy.asarray`
------------------------------------------------------------------
Now `numpy.array` and `numpy.asarray` support three values for ``copy`` parameter:

* ``None`` - A copy will only be made if it is necessary.
* ``True`` - Always make a copy.
* ``False`` - Never make a copy. If a copy is required a ``ValueError`` is raised.

The meaning of ``False`` changed as it now raises an exception if a copy is needed.

The ``__array__`` special method now takes a ``copy`` keyword argument.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

NumPy will pass ``copy`` to the ``__array__`` special method in situations where
it would be set to a non-default value (e.g. in a call to
``np.asarray(some_object, copy=False)``). Currently, if an
unexpected keyword argument error is raised after this, NumPy will print a
warning and re-try without the ``copy`` keyword argument. Implementations of
objects implementing the ``__array__`` protocol should accept a ``copy`` keyword
argument with the same meaning as when passed to `numpy.array` or
`numpy.asarray`.
